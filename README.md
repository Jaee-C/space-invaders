# Space Invaders Game Project
 
This is a space invaders replica made using the `pygame` python library.

## Things To Install

First you'll want to ensure that you have Python 3.6/3.7/3.8/3.9 installed on your computer!

Next, ensure that you have pip installed to ensure you can download the necessary Python Libraries.

You'll want to install to Python Library **PyGame**. To do this, run the following command in your command line:

```python
pip install pygame
```

Lastly, you'll want an appropriate code editor to code. (Duh)

In which case, I recommend downloading Visual Studio Code for this project. You can check it out here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
